# tictactoe-ai

An A.I. that detects wins and plays against human opponents (well more like two A.I.s)

I know that there is probably very bad convention and that I probably have a lot of things wrong, but this is my first neural network and it is a personal project. Thanks :)

Yes, there are easier ways to detect wins in a tic-tac-toe match but I'm **really** bored haha.

UPDATE: as of 23/10/2020 I have transfered the repo to `doctor-diebo` my main account, and I will no longer be detecting wins with a neural network as this is completely useless and I am thinking of implementing this to a legit website.
