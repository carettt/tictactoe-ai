An A.I. that that plays agaisnt human opponents

I know that there is probably very bad convention and that I probably have a lot of things wrong, but this is my first neural network and it is a personal project. Thanks :)

I am going to use the NEAT algorithm as a learning algorithm.

**UPDATE**: as of 23/10/2020 I have transferred the repo to `doctor-diebo` my main account, and I will no longer be detecting wins with a neural network as this is completely useless and I am thinking of implementing this to a legit website.
